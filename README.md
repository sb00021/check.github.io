# Animated Motorcycle: SVG  + GSAP

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/devindavid/pen/rxKJLK](https://codepen.io/devindavid/pen/rxKJLK).

I made the bike in Adobe Illustrator and made it move with Greensock.

I hope you dig it.

Can anyone tell me why CodePen in Chrome is handling the x value tween incorrectly when using percentages? The bike's chain looks wonky here, but looks fine outside of CodePen.
